        "* You may select any of the datasets using Multi-class/binary classification. The goal is to acheve accuracy levels comparable to the benchmark results shown on the medmnist site. Dataloading for pytorch is setup in the notebook, you wil need to modify the code slightly depending on your dataset of choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Some datasets use black and white images, so you will need to [at least concatenate](https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-on-greyscale-images-how-to-fine-tune-pretrained-models-on-black-and-white-9a5150755c7a) the input image channels (to 3 channels) for compatibility with the models pre-trained on imageNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Some of the MedMNIST datasets don't contain too much data so Data augmentation may be essentila essential to avoid overfitting. In pytorch data augmentation is performed using the [transforms.v2](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/transforms.html) modules.\n",

            "    Description: The BloodMNIST is based on a dataset of individual normal cells, captured from individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease and free of any pharmacologic treatment at the moment of blood collection. It contains a total of 17,092 images and is organized into 8 classes. We split the source dataset with a ratio of 7:1:2 into training, validation and test set. The source images with resolution 3×360×363 pixels are center-cropped into 3×200×200, and then resized into 3×28×28.\n",
